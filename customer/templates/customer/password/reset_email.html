Hi there,
<p>
    Someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{ email }}.
</p>

<p>
    Follow the link below:
    {{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'customer:customer_password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}
    
    In case you forgot your CakesAndMore account username: {{ user.username }}
</p>

<p>
    If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL
    in a new browser window instead.
</p>

<p>
    If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered
    your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't
    initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely
    disregard this email.
</p>

<p>
    Thanks,
    The CakesAndMore Web Team
